1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?
SELECT SUM(amount), YEAR(charged_datetime) FROM billing
WHERE YEAR(charged_datetime) = 2012 AND MONTH(charged_datetime) = 3

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client 
with an id of 2?
SELECT SUM(billing.amount), clients.client_id FROM clients
JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 2;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client with an id of 10 owns?
SELECT clients.client_id, GROUP_CONCAT(' ', sites.domain_name) AS 'owned sites' FROM clients
JOIN sites on sites.client_id = clients.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 10;

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for 
the client with an id of 1? What about for client with an id of 20?
SELECT clients.client_id, COUNT(sites.site_id), MONTH(created_datetime), YEAR(created_datetime) FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 1
GROUP BY MONTH(created_datetime)

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the 
sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?
SELECT COUNT(*), sites.domain_name FROM leads
JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE DATE(registered_datetime) >= '2011-01-01' AND DATE(registered_datetime) <= '2011-02-15'
GROUP BY sites.site_id

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of 
leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?
SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, COUNT(*) FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE DATE(leads.registered_datetime) >= '2011-01-01' AND DATE(leads.registered_datetime) <= '2011-12-31'
GROUP BY clients.client_id;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads 
we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS 'clients name', COUNT(leads.leads_id), DATE_FORMAT(leads.registered_datetime, "%M") AS 'month generated' FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE DATE(leads.registered_datetime) >= '2011-01-01' AND DATE(leads.registered_datetime) <= '2011-07-01'
GROUP BY leads.leads_id

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads 
we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 
2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the 
clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for 
all time.
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS 'clients name', sites.domain_name, COUNT(*) FROM clients
JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE DATE(leads.registered_datetime) >= '2011-01-01' AND DATE(leads.registered_datetime) <= '2011-12-31'
GROUP BY sites.site_id
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for 
each month of the year. Order it by client id.  
First try this with integer month, second with month name.  
A SELECT subquery will be needed for the second challenge.  
Look at this for a hint.
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS 'clients name',
SUM(billing.amount), MONTH(charged_datetime), YEAR(charged_datetime)
FROM clients
JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY MONTH(charged_datetime)
ORDER BY clients.client_id;

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. 
Group the results so that all of the sites for each client are displayed in a 
single field. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' 
that has all the sites that the client owns. 
(HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS 'clients name',
GROUP_CONCAT(' ', sites.domain_name) AS sites FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id
